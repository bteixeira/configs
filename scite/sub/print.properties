# # print.magnification	Printing is normally done with the same settings as screen display. To make the printing larger or smaller, the print.magnification setting is added to the size of every font when printed. To get a good miniaturisation of text, set print.magnification to -4.
# # print.colour.mode	Some people prefer light coloured text on a black background on screen but dark text on white on paper. If print.colour.mode is set to 1 then each colour is inverted for printing. If set to 2 then printing produces black text on white background. 3 forces the background to white and 4 forces the default background to white.
# 
# print.header.format
# print.footer.format	These settings determine what will be printed if anything as headers and footers. Property settings can be substituted into the values using the $(property) syntax. There are some extra properties set up while printing: CurrentPage, FileTime, FileDate, CurrentDate, and CurrentTime (at start of printing). Common properties to use in headers and footers are FileNameExt and FilePath.
# A header setting may look like:
# print.header.format=$(FileNameExt) - Printed on $(CurrentDate),$(CurrentTime) - Page $(CurrentPage)
# print.header.style
# print.footer.style	These settings determine the style of the header and footer using the same format as other styles in SciTE. Only the fore, back, font, size, bold, italics, and underlined attributes are supported.
